Hi—I’m Jarrod. I’m a software engineer, startup founder, and (recently) a Dad figuring out how to parent in the age of AI.

My journey hasn’t exactly been linear. I started my career as a collegiate athlete and football coach—competing at Ohio State, coaching at Clemson University, and eventually leading player marketing and corporate innovation for the Los Angeles Rams. My happy place is on the field. 

Alongside sports, my passion for understanding human performance and learning drove me into academia. My research has focused on grit, resilience, and learning design in educational environments, exploring how we can better equip people with the skills, habits, and mindsets needed for long-term success.

Since stepping fully into tech, I’ve been building ecosystems and developer tooling at the intersection of AI, crypto, and open-source platforms. Previously, I led founder success and developer engagement at NEAR Protocol, contributed to Protocol Labs (IPFS, Filecoin), and actively supported open-source developer communities.

Today, I'm building Arc, a memory layer for engineering teams that captures architectural decisions as dynamic, evolving knowledge. Arc moves teams beyond static docs, embedding a shared context directly into their workflows, helping organizations navigate complexity, preserve critical context, and make smarter decisions faster.

I believe we're entering an era where AI increasingly writes our code, transforming engineers from builders into orchestrators and reviewers. My writing dives into this shift—exploring AI memory, the future of developer workflows, and how dynamic world models might finally give us wisdom, not just intelligence.

Outside of tech, you’ll usually find me still chasing peak performance, navigating life's complexities with curiosity and humor, and asking AI way too many questions.
